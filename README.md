Brief Summary of this projects

This project showcases the complete customization and concept design of an online clothes business. Websites are very crucial in markets that offer men's clothing. Because, in other words, the website assists companies in enjoying happy success with customers. In this instance, I go with the apparel business "UNO men's clothes". During my investigation, I discovered several stores had websites and Instagram accounts. In contrast to this statement, UNO had no website, which I considered badly harming their advertising and customer service because, as I indicated, the online structure of their general business could be the face of their improvement.

I made a responsive, 6-page website when it comes to online presence. It contains the home, goods, about, login, and shop pages since they make it easier for visitors to locate certain UNO-related items.

on the first page. The primary navigation bar has been introduced. Additionally, a header was added to the website to make it more beautiful and targeted, improving visitor satisfaction. Furthermore, specific products shown in the images have been added.
on the following page. All facts and references concerning this clothes store have been explained using dynamic animations. Additionally, a header has been added to this page.

The product page contains additional sections and elements, such as photos and various stylistic headers and paragraphs with dynamic hover and animations. The website may be made more pleasant with animations, thus I added more targeted animations to all of the material and graphics. Visitors and followers can feel safe and confident on the Login page because the name, surname, and password contents have been changed and clarified in the exact design.

I included validation routines in JavaScript so that every newly created profile could be preserved and users could use the website without having to sign up again. Additionally, an animation feature has been introduced to the website to make it more engaging for visitors.
This website was developed using solely Java Script, HTML, and CSS, and every modification was committed.
